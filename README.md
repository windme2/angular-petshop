## 🏗️ Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:
```sh
ng generate component component-name
```
For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:
```sh
ng generate --help
```

---

## 📦 Building
To build the project, run:
```sh
ng build
```
This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests
### Unit Tests
To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:
```sh
ng test
```

### End-to-End Tests
For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:
```sh

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
